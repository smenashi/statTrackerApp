//  Class Description:
//  This class creates a modified priority queue for keeping track of the penalized players
//  in box and queued to be in the box (i.e. the third, fourth, etc. player penalized at one
//  time, a very rare edge case). The queue is prioritized by time remaining, so that the player
//  with the least time remaining is released first. The queue is modified slightly to make sure
//  that players not in-box with smaller penalites aren't queued before the in-box players (again,
//  a rare edge case). One queue is created for both the Home and Opponent penalty boxes, referred
//  to as "Us" and "Them."
